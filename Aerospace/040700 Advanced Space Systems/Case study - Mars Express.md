## Learning Objectives

- Explain different trajectories to get to Mars
- Be able to use launch terminology and pork chop plots.
- Describe trajectory and orbit of Mars Express
- Explain concept of planetary quarantine

## Context

Mars Express is a Mars orbiter. In 2003 was the most advantageous launch window in 60,000 years, so very desireable C3, so ESA decided to launch s/s to mars. NASA laucnhed Spirit and Opportunity landers at this time as well.

- Failure of Phobos, Mars Observer, Mars 96 lead to already developed instruments being available, opportunity to send landers.
- Fixed launch date June 2003
- Short development schedule (98/03)
- Launch mass 1100 kg; payload mass 270 kg
- Cost cap (150 Million Euros): $\rightarrow$ best s/c for 60 Million Euros (launch costs is rest of 150 million) $\rightarrow$ best science return
	- Rosetta -> 1 billion euro
	- Mars reconasence -> 500 million euro

Therefore cost is crucial here.

## Trajectories

- Spiral transfer (via electircal)
- Free return transfer (spacecraft sent on big ellipse which intersects mars, and is a period of multiple of earth orbit, so no propellant to get back to earth after flyby of mars)
- Hohmann I and II/Fast transfer
- Gravitational assist

## Payload Instruments

7 instruments

1. Remote observations of surface (high res optical, global IR map)
2. Atmospheric composition and interaction with surface and space
3. Subsurface sounding (radar)
4. In situ chemistry and meteorology by Beagle 2 lander

## Final Orbit Choice

- Launch mass -> s/c mass -> propellant allocation -> reachable apocentre
- Aerobraking not in mission baseline, but in case of main engine failure, can be used to circularise orbit
- Coverage of whole surface surface from low altitude -> Nearly polar orbit, low pericentre
- Use J2 effect of Mars to create global coverage from low altitudes

- Orbit i = 86.4 deg (arrival i = 25 deg) (big change)
- Period 7.5 hours, apocentre 11000 km, pericentre 260 km

## PCP for Mars Express

## Planetary Quarantine Requirements

- Chance of impacting a planet (chances of miss > 99%)
- Important for Earth, Mars, Europa, Titan, etc
- Sometimes, chances of miss must be  > 99.9999 % (for RTG carrying s/c near Earth for example)

## What MEx Found out

![[Pasted image 20210227115935.png]]

They found $CO_2$ and water ice and just water ice by itself!

![[Pasted image 20210227120039.png]]

Plenty of evidence of PAST liquid water on mars

![[Pasted image 20210227120116.png]]

They found permafrost! deep layer of frost below surface -> best place to find life on mars is subsurface environment with water and geothermal heat.

FETCH rover is being sent in future, will send back to earth!

## Summary

- There are many factors that may influence the decision of the interplanetary transfer trajectory for a real mission
	- Spacecraft propulsion (ion or chemical)
	- Desired launch and/or arrival date
	- Available launch energy (C3 / $V_\infty^2$)
	- Planetary quarantine requirements ('very low' chance of impacting planet)
	- Desired orbit on arrival (flyby, orbiter, lander)
