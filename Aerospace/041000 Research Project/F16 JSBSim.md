FBW: FLY BY WIRE

The FBW in most variants (of the F16) will try to protect and escape the aircraft from deep stall, nose slide and spin. Also will reduce inertia-coupling when rolling fast at high AoA. However if the deep stall is very problematic to escape, you can enable MPO  which will allow you to semi override the FBW pitch control. With MPO enabled you can rock the aircraft up and down in bigger and bigger oscillations until the nose stays down and you have scaped the deep stall. For spins, we recommend letting go of the stick and throttle back and let the FBW save the aircraft. In the Yf-16 to escape spins, apply rudder opposite of spin direction and ailerons into the spin direction while pitching down and throttle back. This will often get you into the deep stall where you will rock your way out of that. If you get close to the ground in a departure you can also eject (F6).
