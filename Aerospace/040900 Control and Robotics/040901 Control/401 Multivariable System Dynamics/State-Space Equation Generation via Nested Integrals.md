# State-Space Equation Generation via Nested Integrals

- Summary

    If the equations of motion contain derivatives of $u_i$ how can we find the standard form of $\dot{x} = Ax + Bu  + d$

    It is easiest to explain this derivation method through an example, things sort of *fall into place*.

- Example

    Using the same example as before, but now containing terms of $\dot{u_1}$ and $\dot{u_2}$. Derive the standard form of the state equation.
