# Why Study Nonlinear Control

the above sections indicate that nonlinearities are commonplace in systems, and hence worth of study and ongoing research.

Fortunately, much of the terminology and many of the analytic techniques used for linear systems remain applicable.

By acknowledging that a system exhibits significant nonlinearities, it is generally possible to achieve marked improvements in its stability and controlled performance, as compared to using linear assumptions and linear control design.
