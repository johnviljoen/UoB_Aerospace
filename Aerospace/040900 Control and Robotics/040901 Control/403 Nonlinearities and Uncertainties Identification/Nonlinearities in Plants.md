- Mechanical/Fluid Systems

    Typically, causes of nonlinearity are spring and damping elements. For systems with rotating elements, inertias can also vary significantly if the geometry changes. There can also be a speed-dependent additional mass in the case of bodies moving through fluids. (and an acceleration-dependent additional mass in water, albeit a little more niche)

    **Springs**:

    **Backlash/Play** 

    Found in gears, connectors, machining processes

    **Multiple Springs** 

    Found in overconstrained supports

    **Rate Hardening Springs** 

    Found in ties, membranes, suspensions

    **Damping**:

    **Pressure Drag** 

    Found in moderate to high speed fluid flow

    **Stiction** 

    Found in sliding from rest

    **Non-Newtonian Fluid Viscosity**

    Found in high shear rates, lowish velocity

    **Turbulence**

    Found in high flow rates, sharp corners

    **Masses/Inertias:**

    **Inertia change with geometry**

    Robot arms/manipulators
