# Notes re Lyapunov's Direct Method

A system may have many lyapunov functions.

If a particular $V(x)$ does not satisfy 1, 2.ii and 3 this does not mean that the system is unstable. We only need to find one $V(x)$ which satisfies 1, 2.ii, and 3 in order to show that the system is stable.

A weakness of the direct method is there is no general way to find a Lyapunov function, though various methods have been developed.

Typically we use experience and physical insights to suggest likely candidates for $V(x)$, and then try them out to see which conditions 1, 2.i, 2.ii, and 3 they satisfy.
